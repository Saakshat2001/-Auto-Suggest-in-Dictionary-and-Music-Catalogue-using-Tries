Project is based on a special tree-based data structure known as Trie and it can be used for multiple applications. Because of the special properties of a Trie and the way it is constructed, it enables very fast prefix-based retrieval. It is particularly suitable for application where you want a list of auto-suggestions when you type a partial word. The two major applications that have been combined in this project are 1) dictionary 2) music playlist population and fast look-up.
